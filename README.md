# [Stormy CLI](https://stormyapp.com)

Stormy is a CLI Tool that enables developers to build faster by cutting down the development time.

Stormy empowers the developers in various ways:

1. Reducing Build/Compilation Time.
2. Reducing time to debug build Issues.
3. Providing Analytics over the build.


## Reducing Build Time

Over the time as the repo size increases the time to compile code start increasing. The more time to compile means the developers have to wait longer to see the result of the code changes. Stormy reduces build time by doing massive parallelization of compilation process. We are able to cut the build time of some of the open source projects by 70%.

## Reducing Time to Debug Build Issues.

Builds are often hard to debug for a developer as developers are not the expert in the build processes. They often rely on the build team to fix those issues. The normal process to debug normally involves to many back and forth between the Build Team and the developer. Stormy aims to reduce that by storing the local build logs and making it easy for the Build Team to access the developer logs.

## Providing Analytics over the Build

Stormy provides analytics over the builds providing a bird eye view of the common matrics like number of times test ran, Falky Tests, Build Time etc. This helps the organization in fixing the issue ahead of time.
